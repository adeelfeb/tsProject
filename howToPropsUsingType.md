Ah, I see! You're referring to two common ways of defining props types for a React component, specifically when defining a component's type. Let's break down both approaches:

### 1. **Destructuring Props Directly in the Parameter**

In this approach, you define the props type directly in the function parameter, typically when using function components.

#### Example:
```tsx
type AddTodoProps = {
  onAddTodo: () => void;  // Defining the type for the onAddTodo function
};

const AddTodo = ({ onAddTodo }: AddTodoProps) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onAddTodo}>Add Todo</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AddTodo;
```

#### Explanation:
- **`{ onAddTodo }: AddTodoProps`**: The `AddTodoProps` type is used directly in the function parameter to specify the type of props that the `AddTodo` component expects.
- **Destructuring**: The props object is destructured directly in the parameter, making it easy to access individual props inside the component.
- **Advantages**: This is a concise and clear way of defining and accessing props when you only need to specify the shape of the props object and destructure them directly in the function.

### 2. **Using `React.FC` (React Function Component)**

In this approach, you use `React.FC` (or `React.FunctionComponent`) to define the component type and then pass the props type to it. This is a more formal way of typing functional components.

#### Example:
```tsx
import React from 'react';

type AddTodoProps = {
  onAddTodo: () => void;
};

const AddTodo: React.FC<AddTodoProps> = ({ onAddTodo }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onAddTodo}>Add Todo</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AddTodo;
```

#### Explanation:
- **`React.FC<AddTodoProps>`**: The `React.FC` type is used to specify that `AddTodo` is a functional component that expects props of type `AddTodoProps`. This approach is more explicit and makes it clear that the component is a functional component.
- **Destructuring**: Inside the component, `onAddTodo` is destructured from the props as before.
- **Advantages**: This approach has the benefit of explicitly stating that the component is a functional component (`React.FC`). It can also provide automatic typing for `children` props, although this may not be needed in all cases. Some people prefer `React.FC` for clarity, especially in larger codebases.

### **Key Differences Between the Two Approaches**

| Feature                   | **Destructuring in Parameter**                            | **Using `React.FC`**                                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax**                | More concise, directly destructuring props in the parameter. | More explicit, uses `React.FC<AddTodoProps>` to define the component type. |
| **`children` Prop**        | `children` is not implicitly included.                   | `React.FC` automatically includes the `children` prop if you want to use it. |
| **Type Inference**         | Type inference works without `React.FC` if you type the props separately. | `React.FC` automatically handles props, but may add unnecessary complexity. |
| **Readability**            | More readable and concise for simpler cases.             | More explicit, better for larger projects or when using `children`. |

---

### **Which One to Use?**

- **For simple components** or when you don't need to explicitly define `children`: You can **destructure directly** in the parameter (`const AddTodo = ({ onAddTodo }: AddTodoProps)`), which is shorter and easier to read.
- **For more complex components** or when you need to support `children`: You can use **`React.FC`** (`const AddTodo: React.FC<AddTodoProps> = ({ onAddTodo })`) to define the component type explicitly. This also helps with consistency in large codebases or when you're dealing with a component that might use `children`.

In general, if you're starting out or working with small components, destructuring directly in the parameter is sufficient and more concise. However, if you want more clarity or you're working with more complex components, `React.FC` might be a better choice.
